so, how to sum up on my work?

well, first off, there was a bit more failure than I wanted. A nice little list to start off:
* Denise's Glorious Failures
  * Getting my Auras to play sound clips
  * Photoshopping my triggers to be prettier.....but realizing that they couldn't be read as well
  * Not quite hitting the Guerilla level (Unless you count using corporate boxes and logos without permission, then I am a BADASS).
  * Generally setting the world on fire
  * Overlay flow isn't as smooth as I would like
  * Getting into shenanigans
  * Not quite achieving that smooth story-book approach I was going for.
  
  What I would do better next time is deeeeefinitely invest in camera equipment. While yes, the majority of my triggers work, I feel aesthetics is a huge part of media. Therefore, I feel my work would reach more people if it didn't look (and actually wasn't) like my project's images were taken using a phone camera. Other questions I need to address:
  
   In what ways did this failure illuminate something important about your work? About PH in general? Indeed these are things that even a wild success should think about too. Think carefully about what 'fail' means, in digital history.
