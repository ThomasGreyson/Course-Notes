# Poetic Terrorism and Art as Sabotage

- Anonymous vs. claimed work: Does the art/project lose its meaning or credibility when someone claims it?
- Is it wrong to be afraid of being a guerilla? How much do we want to be pushed beyond our limits? Could my desire for fun and stirring the pot also have unforeseen attachments to it?
- I worry about my unaware status as a white, middle-class woman. While I am still a part of minority groups (sexual orientation, cultural background), I can ignore politics, not take a job, afford rent comfortably and live without fearing for my life. Who am I to decide whose story should be told, or what image should be shown on a wall, simply because I was given the opportunity to learn these skills over someone else who deserves it more.
- Aris seems to have potential but what sort of game- scavenger, collect-em-all, meet-up forums?
-Aris: scene is like the description of chapters on a DVD. Plaques are like different locations where points in your story happen (waypoints in your story). After you add a plaque, you have to physically add it to your story in which you get to choose how it is triggered.
-I'm really starting to like the Aris-genre game. Twinery also good for planning out stories/conversations amongst characters if I was so interested.



##Course Notes supplemental
-With regards to the first oral update next week, I have determined 2 potential projects: A) CU injustices, B) an Aris murder-mystery game. A) is the most guerilla-esque history, and I could choose 3-5 small projections as a rogue-art installation type deal. B) is appealing to me for its fun qualities, but I don't entirely know how to make a wholely work of fiction into a strong, take-notice sort of guerilla project. Will have more on this later after further research into both Ottawa mapping projects and building projections.
